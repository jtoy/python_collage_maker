quickly turn a bunch of images into a collage like this:

![collage](collage.jpg)
Images are labeled 1_1.jpg 1_2.jpg etc for as many rows and cols you want.

Images can be any width and height, by default everything gets converted to 512x512, but you can set it to anything you want.

Images were generated from this [stable diffusion api](https://88stacks.com)


# TODO
* convert it into a cli app
