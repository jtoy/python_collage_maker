quickly turn a bunch of images into a collage like this:

![collage](collage.jpg)
Images are labeled 1_1.jpg 1_2.jpg etc for as many rows and cols you want.
to install:
pip install -r requirements.txt
to run call: python collage.py path_to_images 3 5

Images can be any width and height, by default everything gets converted to 512x512, but you can set it to anything you want.

Images were generated from this [stable diffusion api](https://88stacks.com)
